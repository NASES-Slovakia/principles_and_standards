# Definition

This standard mandates that all organizational tasks be managed through a centralized Task Management System, with resource management and timesheet tracking fully integrated. The aim is to ensure comprehensive visibility and accountability for all work conducted by the organization.

# Purpose

To establish consistent and effective resource management practices across the organization. By ensuring that all tasks are documented in the Task Management System, we promote structured work planning, efficient use of resources, and the ability to track progress comprehensively, thereby enhancing project oversight and individual accountability.

# Scope

This standard applies to all projects, teams, and individual contributors within the organization. It includes, but is not limited to, tasks related to project execution, operational duties, and support activities.

# Rationale

- **Transparency and Accountability**: Documenting all tasks ensures transparency into what work is being done, by whom, and at what time, leading to increased accountability at all organizational levels.
- **Resource Optimization**: Proper resource management allows for the effective allocation of human and material resources. Integrating timesheeting helps track effort spent and provides data to optimize resource allocation in future planning.
- **Efficient Planning and Reporting**: Utilizing a unified Task Management System ensures consistency in planning, execution, and reporting, facilitating better tracking of dependencies, milestones, and potential bottlenecks.

# Requirements

## Task Entry Requirement

- All tasks must be documented in the Task Management System before work begins, especially if the task is estimated to take more than one hour to complete.
- A task is considered mandatory and actionable only after it has been properly recorded in the Task Management System.

## Time Tracking and Timesheeting

- All contributors must log the time spent on individual tasks into the Task Management System to ensure accurate reporting of resource utilization.
- Time logs must be updated regularly to maintain an accurate reflection of ongoing work, with updates required at least once per day.

## Resource Management Integration

- Resource allocation, including team members assigned to specific tasks, must be clearly defined and managed within the Task Management System.
- The system should be utilized to provide visibility into workload balancing and availability of resources.

## Dependencies and Scheduling

- All tasks must indicate their dependencies and deadlines. This allows for coordinated scheduling and improved prediction of project timelines.

# Compliance

## Audits

- Regular audits will be conducted to ensure that tasks and time entries are recorded according to the standard. The purpose of the audits is to identify any deviations from the standard and to take corrective action if needed.

## Non-compliance

- Any instance of non-compliance must be documented, and an action plan must be created to ensure that similar deviations do not occur in the future.

# Documentation

## Task Details

- Each task entered into the system must include a description, assigned resources, estimated duration, dependencies, and due dates.

## Reporting and Tracking

- The system must be used to generate periodic reports, which will help identify resource utilization patterns and support strategic decision-making processes.
