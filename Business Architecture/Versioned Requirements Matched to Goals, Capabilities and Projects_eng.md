# Statement

Key requirements must be versioned and aligned with organizational goals, capabilities, and projects, and interlinked by dependencies before the development of architecture concepts.

# Rationale

Ensuring that key requirements are versioned and mapped to specific goals, capabilities, and projects, with clearly defined dependencies, provides a structured approach to architecture development. This practice enhances traceability, accountability, and alignment with business objectives, leading to more coherent and effective architectural solutions.

# Implications

## Requirements Management

- All key requirements should be documented, versioned, and maintained in a centralized repository.
- Version control mechanisms must be in place to track changes and maintain historical records of requirements.

## Alignment with Business Goals

- Each requirement must be explicitly linked to one or more business goals to ensure alignment with organizational objectives.
- Regular reviews should be conducted to validate that requirements continue to support evolving business goals.

## Capabilities Mapping

- Requirements should be mapped to the specific capabilities they aim to enhance or develop.
- Capability maps should be maintained and updated to reflect the relationships between requirements and capabilities.

## Project Integration

- Requirements must be associated with the projects that will implement them.
- Project plans should reflect the dependencies and timelines associated with the requirements.

## Dependency Management

- Clearly define and document dependencies between requirements, capabilities, and projects.
- Use dependency management tools to visualize and manage these relationships effectively.

## Pre-Architecture Analysis

- Conduct a thorough analysis of requirements, goals, capabilities, and project dependencies before developing architecture concepts.
- Ensure that all relevant stakeholders are involved in this analysis to gather comprehensive insights.

## Traceability

- Maintain traceability from requirements to goals, capabilities, and projects to ensure accountability and facilitate impact analysis.
- Use traceability matrices or similar tools to support this process.

## Change Management

- Establish a formal change management process to handle modifications to requirements and their dependencies.
- Communicate changes promptly to all stakeholders and update documentation accordingly.

## Documentation

- Ensure comprehensive documentation of requirements, their versions, dependencies, and mappings to goals, capabilities, and projects.
- Keep documentation up-to-date and accessible to all relevant stakeholders.

## Quality Assurance

- Implement quality assurance practices to verify that requirements are accurately captured, versioned, and aligned with business objectives.
- Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with this principle.
