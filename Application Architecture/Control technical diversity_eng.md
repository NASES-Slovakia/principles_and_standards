## Statement
Technological diversity is controlled to minimize significant costs related to the maintenance of expertise and connectivity between several different environments.  

## Rationale
There is a real and significant cost related to the infrastructure required to support alternative technologies.  

Limiting the number of supported components simplifies and reduces maintenance and management costs.  

A smaller number of software packages represent a greater ease and lower integration costs.  

## Implications
Policies, standards, and procedures that regulate the acquisition of technology or contracting with new suppliers must be directly bound to this principle whether via non-functional requirements or internal standards.  

This principle does not require freezing the technological baseline. Technological advances are welcome and included into the standards and technological blueprint when they are compatible with current infrastructures, are likely to improve operating efficiency, or there is a need to increase capacity.
