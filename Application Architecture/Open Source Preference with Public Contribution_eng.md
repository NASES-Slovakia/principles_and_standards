# Statement

The organization must prioritize the use of open source software over closed-source alternatives whenever feasible, while ensuring that the selected software provides options for commercial support. All developed open source and bespoke code, funded through public investments, must be published as a public Git repository to foster transparency, collaboration, and innovation.

# Rationale

Using open source software provides numerous advantages, including greater transparency, flexibility, and potential cost savings. Open source fosters community collaboration, enables inspection and improvement by diverse contributors, and mitigates vendor lock-in risks. However, to ensure stability and reliability in mission-critical systems, a commercial support option should be available when needed.

Publishing code funded by public money as a public Git repository aligns with the principles of openness and accountability, ensuring that the benefits of publicly funded developments are shared with society at large. It encourages reuse, community contribution, and establishes the organization as a responsible participant in the global technology ecosystem.

# Implications

## Preference for Open Source Solutions

When evaluating software options, priority must be given to open source software over closed-source alternatives. This preference allows for greater transparency, the potential for custom modifications, and alignment with community-driven innovation.

## Availability of Commercial Support

In cases where open source software is chosen, there must be an option for obtaining commercial support to ensure reliability, especially for critical systems. This support can include service level agreements (SLAs), security patching, and professional guidance, ensuring stability for enterprise-grade deployments.

## Publication of Publicly Funded Code

All bespoke software, modifications, and open source contributions funded through public investment must be published as a public Git repository. This ensures that the public can access, review, and potentially reuse the code, thereby maximizing the value derived from public spending. The repository must be properly documented, including information on setup, configuration, and usage.

## Avoidance of Vendor Lock-In

Open source solutions are preferred in order to minimize vendor lock-in and increase interoperability between different systems. By using open standards and open source tools, the organization retains flexibility and reduces dependency on proprietary vendors.

## Security and Quality Considerations

All open source solutions must undergo security reviews to verify their safety and suitability for the intended use. Additionally, any custom-developed open source code must adhere to industry best practices in software development, with particular focus on code quality, testing, and security, before it is published publicly.

## Community Engagement

By publishing open source code, the organization encourages community engagement and contributions. Developers both inside and outside of the organization should be encouraged to contribute to the published projects, fostering a collaborative development culture that helps improve the software.

## License Compatibility

All open source components and bespoke code must adhere to licensing standards that allow for both internal use and publication. Licensing must ensure compliance with intellectual property laws and allow others to freely use, modify, and distribute the software, under conditions aligned with open source principles.
