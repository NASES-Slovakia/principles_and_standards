# Statement

Data should be provided and maintained by its authoritative source (master system) to ensure accuracy, consistency, and integrity across the organization.

# Rationale

Having data managed by its master source ensures that it is accurate, consistent, and up-to-date. This approach minimizes data redundancy, reduces errors, and enhances data quality. Relying on the authoritative source for data also simplifies data governance and ensures compliance with regulatory and organizational standards.

# Implications

## Data Management

- Identify and designate authoritative sources (master systems) for critical data entities.
- Ensure that data maintenance and updates are performed in these master systems.

## Integration

- All systems requiring access to master data should integrate directly with the master source.
- Implement robust data integration mechanisms to synchronize data between master sources and consuming systems.

## Data Governance

- Establish data governance policies that enforce the use of master sources for data provision and maintenance.
- Define roles and responsibilities for data stewardship to ensure data quality and integrity.

## Data Consistency

- Implement data validation rules and synchronization processes to ensure data consistency across all systems.
- Regularly audit data to detect and rectify inconsistencies.

## Change Management

- Any changes to data structures or processes within master systems must be communicated to all stakeholders and systems consuming the data.
- Plan and manage data migrations carefully to ensure continuity and integrity when transitioning data ownership or integrating new master sources.

## Compliance and Security

- Ensure that master data sources comply with relevant regulatory, legal, and security requirements.
- Implement appropriate access controls and data protection measures to secure master data.

## Performance and Scalability

- Design master data systems to handle the performance and scalability requirements of the organization.
- Monitor the performance of master data sources and optimize them to handle increasing loads and queries from consuming systems.

## Documentation

- Maintain comprehensive documentation of master data sources, including data models, interfaces, and integration points.
- Ensure that data consumers have access to up-to-date documentation for accurate data usage.
