# Definition

Documentation and manuals are an integral part of application source code. All source code has to be stored in NASES GitLab or GitHub repository.

# Purpose

To ensure consistency of source code, documentation, and manuals.

# Scope

This standard applies to all custom-made software and all off-the-shelf product integrations owned by the organization.

# Rationale

- Git is the industry standard for storing source code and revisions of text documents.
- Project deliveries should be accepted only in a Git repository in NASES GitHub or GitLab.
- The repository should be the single source of truth; other published copies may exist for convenience but should reference the version in the original repository.

# Requirements

- Text-based formats of documentation and manuals are preferred, e.g., Markdown and dialects versioned together with the application source code.
- Binary documentation formats are accepted only if they are existing documentation for off-the-shelf solutions.
- Sensitive information should only be referenced and should not be stored in the repository.

# Compliance

Only projects with source code, manuals, and documentation following this standard should be accepted.
