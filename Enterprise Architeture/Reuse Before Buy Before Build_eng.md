# Statement

This principle guides in first looking at the reuse of existing solutions that are needed when considering new alternatives. When new solutions are needed, consider buying instead of building.

# Rationale

- Improves cost efficiency, reduces the total cost of ownership, reduces complexity, and reduces time to market.
- Reuse is key to achieving rapid deployment of solutions without major development effort and risk.
- Packaged solutionsâ€™ built-in processes are well-tested and based on market standards.
- Highly customizing packaged solutions leads to high maintenance costs as it is difficult to follow package upgrades and patches once a solution is customized.
- Building solutions from scratch requires functional and technical expertise and experience, adding risk to deployment and technical performance.

# Implications

- Look at internal existing solutions within the company before buying.
- Architectural components should be centralized and designed for reuse to minimize the cost of developing new systems.
- Software license agreements and system development contracts should be written to allow for reuse.
- If a packaged solution is chosen, avoid high levels of customization (more than 30% of the package).
