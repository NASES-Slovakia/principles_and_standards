NASES will adopt a Data Fabric architecture to unify data management, enhance interoperability, and enable intelligent automation across distributed data environments.

## Rationale

The current data landscape is fragmented, limiting scalability, governance, and real-time access.  
A Data Fabric approach leverages active metadata, automated orchestration, and self-service capabilities to:

* Ensure data consistency and lineage across systems
* Support compliance, security, and performance requirements
* Facilitate change management and documentation for master data sources

This transformation will empower stakeholders with trusted, accessible, and actionable data while reducing integration complexity.

## Implications

### Metadata Management

* Active metadata must be captured, enriched, and used to drive automation and governance

### Data Lineage and Observability

* The flow and transformation of data must be traceable to ensure trust, compliance, and debugging

### Data Orchestration and Automation

* Data movement, transformation, and governance should be orchestrated across platforms

### Self-Service Enablement

* Users should be empowered to discover, access, and use data without deep technical support
