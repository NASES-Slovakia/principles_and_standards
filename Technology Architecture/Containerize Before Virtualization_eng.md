# Statement

Prioritize the use of containerization technologies over virtualization for application deployment to maximize resource efficiency, scalability, and agility.

# Rationale

- **Efficiency**: Containers share the host operating system kernel, leading to lower overhead compared to virtual machines, which require separate OS instances.
- **Scalability**: Container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) enable efficient scaling of applications and services.
- **Agility**: Containers facilitate continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes, supporting faster development cycles.
- **Portability**: Containers encapsulate application dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments (development, testing, production).

# Implications

- **Infrastructure**: Need for robust container orchestration and management tools.
- **Skills**: Upskilling teams to effectively use containerization technologies and practices.
- **Security**: Implementing container-specific security measures to mitigate risks.
- **Integration**: Adapting existing CI/CD pipelines to support containerized workflows.
